In a [previous post]({% post_url 2014-05-08-flipped-corporate-training %}), I talked about what’s Flipped Classrom and why it is important to use it in corporate trainings. In this post, I offer a couple more references and tips on Flipped Trainning:

 - You are not a trainer. You are an student’s student. Prepare tools, exams and exercises to help you diagnose and adapt your classes on-the-fly. Teach what the students need to learn, not what is in a curriculum guide or what *you* like to teach.
 - Provide specific ways for each individual to learn as deeply as possible and as quickly as possible, choosing what, how much and when to learn. You could, for example, divide your course and reading material in distinct categories, like “required”, “recommended” and “excelence path”. Or “10 minutes”, “30 minutes” and “90+ minutes”.
 - Accept and act on the premise that the trainers must be ready to engage students in instruction through different learning modalities, by appealing to differing interests, and by using varied rates of instruction along with varied degrees of complexity. Use images, videos, audio, quizzes, exams, labs, test cases for coding exercises, etc. Be creative!
